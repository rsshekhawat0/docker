## IIEC DOCKER PROJECT 
 I have learnt the docker under the guidence of **MR.Vimal Daga sir** in campaign **IIEC-RISE 1.0** which is his intiative on youtube.
Summary:
i have created a docker project in which is using container technology 
as u all know if u want to make a website using wordpress u have start your os 
then you have to configure the wordpress to use it and the u also have to configure 
the database to use the wordpress 
and i may have take around half an hour
and here i have made an project with the help of the container technology
which will run your os then it will configure your wordpress and the it will setup 
your database within seconds you dont have to wait for hours and u dont have to work
too hard to confugre the wordpress.

here i have used volumes for mount the folder with container
if we want the container to be accessed by public then we can use patting 
so anyone outside the world can access this container
here i have use containers because this is very fast(it installs and start the os very fast)
and i want to ready the setup very fast.
here i have use the docker compose because i want to run multiple containers
and this is not a good practice that i will go and run each and every container
thats why i used docker compose so i can run multiple container
for using docker compose we have to configure a yml file and then we have to just run it then it 
will run every thing whatever is present inside it
